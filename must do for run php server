this steps need to do for run xampp control pannel after you killed you can run php server(ckick start apache)
why are we checking and killing ports 80 and 443?

Let me explain in simple words 👇

✅ WHY this is needed (Simple Explanation)

XAMPP → Apache needs two ports to start:

Port 80 → for normal websites

Port 443 → for HTTPS websites

If another program is already using these ports, Apache cannot start.

So we check who is using the port and kill it → then Apache can start correctly.

📝 Common apps that block port 80 / 443

These programs usually take port 80 or 443:

✔ Skype
✔ IIS (Windows Web Server)
✔ VMware
✔ Docker
✔ Antivirus Web Shield
✔ Another Apache / Nginx
✔ Web Deployment Agent

When any of these run → XAMPP gives error:
❌ Port 80 in use
❌ Apache not starting

That’s why we free the ports.

📌 Think of it like this:

Apache = needs two seats
Ports 80 & 443 = two seats

If someone else is sitting there → Apache has no place to sit → it stops.

So we:

Check who is sitting (netstat)

Remove them (taskkill)

Apache can sit again (start)

🎯 Final answer (short version)

We are doing this to:

✔ Allow Apache in XAMPP to start
✔ Free port 80 & 443
✔ Remove other apps blocking the port

there can be side effects, but only depending on what program you kill.

I will explain clearly and simply.

✅ Will killing the port process harm your PC?
**👉 No. Your PC will NOT get damaged.

👉 But the app you kill will stop working until restarted.**

That’s all.

⚠️ Possible Side Effects (depends on the app you kill)

Here are common programs that use port 80/443 and what happens if you kill them:

1️⃣ If you kill Skype

✔ Skype call may disconnect
✔ Skype will restart automatically sometimes
❗ No big problem

2️⃣ If you kill IIS / Web Deployment Agent

✔ Your Windows local web server will stop
❗ Useful only for developers
✔ Safe to kill

3️⃣ If you kill VMware / VirtualBox services

✔ Your virtual machines might pause/stop
❗ Only if you use them
✔ Safe to kill if not running VMs

4️⃣ If you kill Antivirus Web Shield

✔ Your browser protection may reduce a little
❗ No danger
✔ Antivirus will restart again automatically

5️⃣ If you kill another Apache/Nginx process

✔ That web server will stop
✔ But you need it free for your own XAMPP
✔ Safe to kill

6️⃣ If you kill SYSTEM (PID 4)

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT:

You cannot kill PID 4
Windows will protect it
If PID 4 uses port 80 → a Windows service is using it
(Usually "HTTP.sys")

I can tell you how to disable it safely if needed.

🛑 IMPORTANT
👉 Killing a process does NOT delete anything
👉 It does NOT damage your PC
👉 You can always restart the program again

So it is completely safe unless you kill something you need at that moment.

👍 Conclusion

✔ Safe: Yes

✔ No damage: Yes

❗ App using the port will temporarily stop

here is the SUPER SIMPLE method — only 3 easy steps to check and kill ports 80 + 443.

✅ STEP 1 — Open CMD as Administrator

Click Start

Type cmd

Right-click → Run as Administrator

✅ STEP 2 — Check BOTH ports (80 + 443)

Copy & paste this:

netstat -ano | findstr :80
netstat -ano | findstr :443


You will see something like this:

TCP 0.0.0.0:80   LISTENING   1234
TCP 0.0.0.0:443  LISTENING   5678


👉 The last number is PID (Process ID).
Example:

Port 80 → PID 1234

Port 443 → PID 5678

✅ STEP 3 — Kill the process

If you got PID 1234 →

taskkill /PID 1234 /F


If you got PID 5678 →

taskkill /PID 5678 /F


Done. ✔
Now ports 80 and 443 are free for XAMPP.

⭐ BONUS: Kill both in one line (if you know the PIDs)

Example:

taskkill /PID 1234 /PID 5678 /F
